### Data Flow

```
Component Mount → Fetch Reports → Display in Table
↓
User Actions:
- Create → API Call → Refresh List → Show Toast
- View → API Call → Show Modal
- Edit → API Call → Refresh List → Show Toast
- Delete → Confirm → API Call → Refresh List → Show Toast
- Filter Change → API Call with params → Update Table
```

## Authorization & Permissions

### Report Creation

- Any authenticated user with HR, Admin, or Staff role can create reports
- Uses access token from `useAuth()` hook

### Report Viewing

- Users can view reports where they are:
  - The author
  - A recipient
  - (API handles the filtering)

### Report Editing

- Only the report author can edit their reports
- UI conditionally shows edit button based on author check
- API enforces this on the backend as well

### Report Deletion

- Only the report author can delete their reports
- Requires confirmation dialog
- UI conditionally shows delete button based on author check

## Data Mapping

### Form to API

```javascript
Form Field          → API Field
-----------------------------------------
title              → reportTitle
description        → reportDescription
type               → reportType
department         → department
priority           → priorityLevel (capitalized)
dueDate            → dueDate
recipients         → recipients (array of user IDs)
```

### API to Display

```javascript
API Field          → Display
-----------------------------------------
reportTitle        → Report column
reportType         → Type column
department         → Department column
priorityLevel      → Priority badge
author object      → Author name
createdAt          → Created date (formatted)
dueDate            → Due date (formatted)
```

## Error Handling

### Network Errors

- Caught and displayed via toast notifications
- Console logging for debugging
- User-friendly error messages

### Validation Errors

- Required field validation in form
- API validation errors shown via toast
- Form remains open for correction

### Authorization Errors

- 401/403 errors caught and displayed
- User redirected if necessary
- Clear error messages

## State Management

### Component State

```javascript
- reports: Array of report objects from API
- loading: Boolean for fetch operations
- submitting: Boolean for form submissions
- pagination: Object with page info
- selectedReport: Currently viewed report
- isModalOpen: Create/Edit modal visibility
- isViewModalOpen: View modal visibility
- isEditMode: Whether modal is in edit mode
- editingReportId: ID of report being edited
```

### Filters State

```javascript
- searchQuery: Text search filter
- typeFilter: Report type filter
- statusFilter: Report status filter
- departmentFilter: Department filter
- priorityFilter: Priority level filter
```

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Cases to Cover

1. ✅ Create a new report
2. ✅ View report details
3. ✅ Edit own report
4. ✅ Delete own report
5. ✅ Try to edit someone else's report (should not show button)
6. ✅ Try to delete someone else's report (should not show button)
7. ✅ Filter by department
8. ✅ Filter by priority
9. ✅ Search functionality
10. ✅ Pagination
11. ✅ Tab switching (My Reports vs Employee Reports)

### API Integration Testing

```javascript
// Example: Test creating a report
const testReport = {
  reportTitle: "Test Performance Report",
  reportDescription: "This is a test report for Q4 performance",
  department: "Engineering",
  reportType: "Performance",
  priorityLevel: "High",
  dueDate: "2025-12-31",
  recipients: [], // Optional: Add user IDs
};

// Call from component or directly test the API
import { reportsApi } from "@/services/reportsApi";
const result = await reportsApi.createReport(testReport, accessToken);
console.log(result);
```

## Environment Variables

No additional environment variables needed. Uses existing `apiConfig.js` configuration.
